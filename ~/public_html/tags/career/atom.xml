&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-background&#34;&gt;Some background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may know me from the various meetups in the city, especially my attendance at a number of &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship&#34;&gt;LSCC&lt;/a&gt; meetup events. Attending these events I learnt about various conferences like &lt;strong&gt;Devoxx&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SoCraTes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;JAX London&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Java2Days&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;OpenFest&lt;/strong&gt;, and I ended up attending and later presenting on various topic including &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/projects/adoptopenjdk/pages/AdoptOpenJDK&#34;&gt;Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time I met a lot of people with various levels of experience and my interest and urge to learn more about the Java/JVM platform, Code Quality, Software Design, XP Practices, Software Craftsmanship, etc&amp;hellip;, were on the rise and saw no end. And whilst attending these events I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sandromancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mashooq&#34;&gt;Mash&lt;/a&gt;, who were in those days hosting &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship&#34;&gt;LSCC&lt;/a&gt; events. I went to many of &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship&#34;&gt;LSCC&lt;/a&gt; events, especially liked the hands-on sessions (which are still my favourite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that many things I learnt at such events and conferences wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always be immediately recognised or accepted at the workplace. And moving to another work environment didn&amp;rsquo;t always solve this problem fully. I found that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t learning what I wanted from my peers and the things I learnt from the community I couldn&amp;rsquo;t apply at work. Besides very few were really in tuned with what the community was about. So one fine day I decided to take charge of my career and make a serious decision and take up the Apprenticeship program offered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt; and go through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was urged to go this way after being inspired by Sandro&amp;rsquo;s book: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/0134052501&#34;&gt;The Software Craftsman&lt;/a&gt;, attending all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://socratesuk.org/&#34;&gt;SoCraTes UK&lt;/a&gt; conferences, and meeting with developers who valued and took pride of their work namely their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-we-are-just-now&#34;&gt;Where we are just now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now been nearly two months since I have been working for &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt;, a formidable force. And so it&amp;rsquo;s also about time that I share my experiences with my fellow mates and the community around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first few weeks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt;, I have been busy learning various things that have been chalked out for becoming a craftsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working on a kata or learning a concept, we paired or did what is known as &amp;lsquo;mob programming&amp;rsquo; along with other apprentices and craftsmen. And most of the time used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;. Time boxing our work in intervals is something done both in groups and working individually. We would have a lot of discussions and retrospectives after working on a problem or writing some code from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;structure-of-my-program&#34;&gt;Structure of my program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used an internal tool based on the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.impactmapping.org/&#34;&gt;Impact Mapping&lt;/a&gt;. I soon got interested in it when I saw my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Singsalad&#34;&gt;Franzi&lt;/a&gt; (who is now a craftswoman) had used it to plan out her Apprenticeship route. Such a tool helps map out our goals and the tasks we need to perform to achieve it. And this can differ from person-to-person, depending on what they want to work on (driven by the Apprentice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mentor and other craftsmen reviewed them to get an idea of what I wanted to achieve for myself. And then its up to me to apply my own drive and perseverance to achieve the individual stories. My mentor and I meet and talk informally on a regular basis, many times pairing on a kata or a project or on the white board trying to get my head around a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;days-in-the-life-of-an-apprentice&#34;&gt;Days in the life of an Apprentice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the working hours quite flexible, remote working is also an option (when you are on the bench or if the client allows, if you are in a project). Our co-founders are understanding and compassionate about our individual situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings are at their minimum, except for a weekly Apprentices meeting (run by an Apprentice and guided by at least one Craftsperson) and a bi-monthly company-wide catchup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apprentices meetings are full of fun &amp;ndash; we are accompanied by at least one Craftsperson, who disperses their knowledge and experience from a wide variety of topics designed to help us in the journey and fill the gaps in our knowledge and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bi-monthly catchup involves sharing of knowledge via lightning talks, discussions and pairing sessions on pet projects over pizzas and beer (and of course veggies and non-alcoholic beverages for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism&#34;&gt;teetotalers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katas, code reviews, mob programming and projects make up a learning week - all of these done individually or when pairing with another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;katas&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis I have worked on different katas or try to solve the same kata in various different ways (using different testing and refactoring approaches). This in turn gave me better insights into designing and refactoring techniques. Trying to solve the same problem in different ways has a positive impact on our problem solving skills especially when writing code. In my case I also learnt how to use the different libraries and methods to write tests. I would like to cite &lt;strong&gt;Samir&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to you, for the suggesting this approach during the first week of my Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;code-reviews&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week we did a group code review and time-boxed ourselves, performed a retrospective at the end of each interval and ensured we delivered a good chunk of the feedback before close of play. Such regular code review exercises are helping all of us learn about how to code better as we are not only learning from feedback from the tools we used, but also through exchange of feedback from our peers who were involved in the group code review session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;software-design-specification-gathering-communication&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Design, Specification Gathering &amp;amp; Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we had an interesting mob-programming session where we were trying to model and write a game. At the end of the session, we had a retrospective, discussing the things we did well and didn&amp;rsquo;t do well. Each of the apprentices and craftsmen were performing a specific role i.e. Developer, Domain Expert, etc&amp;hellip; We learnt in retrospective, about areas where we could have done better and should focus on. That any test written gives immediate feedback about how well we have understood the domain and if we were taking the right approach. Why a certain approach when starting a project is more advantageous than another approach. What questions to ask and why it is important to ask the right questions to the domain expert or to give the right level of information to another developer and vice-versa. Sandro has described this process in detail in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/2015/11/01/practicing-well-crafted-design/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fun-socialising-and-sharing&#34;&gt;Fun, socialising and sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found our office environment to be conducive to learning, sharing and collaboration. We even have a pairing rota that we use from time-to-time to record or suggest pairing sessions during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share links to events, conferences, tweets, interesting articles, videos, blog posts, etc&amp;hellip; via slack, document discussions and brain dumps via Google doc, huddles during lunch- and tea- breaks to talk about anything we are working on. Thanks to the library of printed and digital books to our disposal, the huge collection of &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/blog&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/videos/&#34;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; on our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apprentices and some craftsmen have collectively started a social event which of course happens every Friday, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s dinner at a nearby restaurant, while at other times an indoor movie over snacks and drinks at our office premises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-is-worthwhile-and-that-s-why-we-are-here&#34;&gt;It is worthwhile and that&amp;rsquo;s why we are here&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a privilege to be able to work alongside very experienced craftsmen from our industry. We are very lucky and thankful to have the opportunity to be guided and mentored by talented and like minded developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first job where the company has a completely flat hierarchy and where we share similar values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-note&#34;&gt;Closing note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is fun and learning is enjoyable when we love what we do and are amongst friends with similar goals and aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope it was interesting. Looking forward to write more and share such experiences in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Sandro&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tomaz&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Alex&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Franzi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David&lt;/strong&gt; for all the feedback provided for this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should always follow your dreams!</title>
      <link>http://codurance.com/blog/Why-you-should-always-follow-your-dreams%21/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2015 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://codurance.com/blog/Why-you-should-always-follow-your-dreams%21/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started at &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt; a month and a half ago as a C# developer. I was glad to have the opportunity to work in a place where people value your effort to be a better developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been away from C# for more than 4 years, but I was happy to return. This was for me a great opportunity to catch up with my main language. But my passion is with iOS. In my own time, I started to apply all the techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning, especially on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ananogal.com/blog/starting-your-tdd-journey/&#34;&gt;honing my TDD skills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/2015/07/13/How-to-start-doing-TDD-in-iOS/&#34;&gt;applying TDD to iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did I apply for C# and not iOS? Well, I looked for three months for a iOS company that could give me an opportunity. It was really hard. They all wanted senior developers who could get there and get the job done, but I&amp;rsquo;m not at that level in iOS yet. I still have a lot to learn and I needed an opportunity to learn more from experienced developers, exchange thoughts and understand how things work. Working in C#, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with several clients, I know how to address a problem, and how I can put my expertise to help, but that&amp;rsquo;s not yet true when working on iOS projects. This kind of experience is what I missed from my journey in the world of apps. I&amp;rsquo;m the primary developer of 4 apps, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough. I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed them all to the App Store, despite having to dedicate a whole day to it every time! But I was my own client. They all started as small pet projects that got big enough for me to stay at home for four years and try to make it work. I really loved it, but I missed the exchange  of experience in a team. This is what makes you grow in your profession. The great discussions that a subject can lead to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So two weeks ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sandromancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that we had an opportunity in iOS. A client was willing to have me as an apprentice, if I could pass the interview. I was thrilled that I could pursue my dream! Given a choice between iOS or C#, I will always choose iOS, but I never thought that Codurance would help me fulfill my dream. I can definitely be more profitable in C# than in iOS, but Codurance choose to give me an opportunity to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my first job, where I stayed for 7 years, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the same feeling. I still say &amp;ldquo;my company&amp;rdquo; when I&amp;rsquo;m talking about them with friends. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in several companies not only in Portugal but also in Spain. None of them made me feel a team member or cared about my opinions. My colleagues have made me want to be a better person, not only a better developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! by the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve done the interview and I started yesterday. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two weeks, I reviewed everything I learnt about software development and applied it to Objective-C. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a lot! Even doing katas has made me investigate and discover all sorts of new concepts and approaches. But that will be the topic for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have a dream and you can&amp;rsquo;t pursue it right away, don&amp;rsquo;t lose the passion for it, and never ever put it in a drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first month as an apprentice</title>
      <link>http://codurance.com/blog/a-month-of-apprenticeship/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2015 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://codurance.com/blog/a-month-of-apprenticeship/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I started my apprenticeship at Codurance. I have learned a lot already in these few weeks, and I want to share some of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-little-background&#34;&gt;A little background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I moved from Germany over to London to work for Codurance. I knew the founders and some of the craftsmen from various conferences, mainly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.socrates-conference.de/&#34;&gt;SoCraTes Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://socratesuk.org/&#34;&gt;SoCraTes UK&lt;/a&gt;.
Apart from wanting to immerse myself into the vibrant &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/&#34;&gt;London Software Craftsmanship Community&lt;/a&gt;, I was looking for an opportunity to learn about better software design.
I studied computer science at university, where I learned about UML and the theoretics of design patterns. I worked as a developer and consultant for three years in Germany and got some basic training on clean code and XP techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But going to Software Craftsmanship events, especially the international ones, made me realize there is so much more to learn. I attribute my ignorance to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning Kruger&lt;/a&gt; effect. Or the fact that there weren&amp;rsquo;t many people who understood.
I tried to get some advice from my peers and the answers I heard were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;You just need to spend a few years gaining more experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is as far as you can go with learning about good design&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The training you are looking for doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, you can train special frameworks and technologies instead&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your career options are management or full time process consulting&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, given my personality and my goals, this &amp;lsquo;advice&amp;rsquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t satisfy me. Here is what I tried instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started organizing events to improve by pairing with other motivated coders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I booked a one-on-one, advanced design training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used my free time to participate in as many meetups and conferences as I could&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, for 40 hours a week, in my comfortable, reasonably agile team, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t improving much. And there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough people senior to me that I could learn from.
One example is that we were proposing to use the same technology stack for almost every project we started. We used Spring, Hibernate and other frameworks that forced us into a particular design.
And a lot of the new things I was trying to bring in from outside were rejected, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t practice them in a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I heard &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sandromancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mashooq&#34;&gt;Mash&lt;/a&gt; talk about how important it is to spend your main working time somewhere you can improve, it really hit home. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/0134052501&#34;&gt;The Software Craftsman&lt;/a&gt;, I read inspiring words about what it meant to take charge of your career.
I realized I needed to make a bigger change to get where I wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit my job (it had three months notice) and applied in London, hoping to get accepted at Codurance. I was intrigued by the opportunity to work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/aboutus/ourteam/&#34;&gt;awesome craftsmen&lt;/a&gt; and to have a few months of focussed learning in my apprenticeship.
As it turned out, I was a fit and they wanted me to start as early as possible. Organizing the move with no vacation time in between my jobs was a challenge, but I managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;starting-my-apprenticeship&#34;&gt;Starting my apprenticeship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on I understood that I was the person driving my apprenticeship. Both the company and I benefit from me graduating, but it&amp;rsquo;s my responsibility to get there.
This is very different from studying at university, where you have a syllabus, exams and credits to collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by identifying what Codurance expects from their craftsmen. Some things had already been covered in the application process and in conversations I had with Codurance employees before. There was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/careers/craftsman/&#34;&gt;job description&lt;/a&gt; and a list of values in the Codurance wiki.
From those, I identified I wanted to focus on improving my design and DevOps skills. Other important aspects are writing and presenting, and getting involved in the Software Craftsmanship Community.
I made a list of tasks I wanted to do to reach my goals and got encouraging feedback from the founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mentorship&#34;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to find a mentor to guide me and help me to focus on my goal to graduate. I had a chat with the available craftsmen about how they could help me and what they expected from me.
And from the ones that offered, I chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar&#34;&gt;Samir&lt;/a&gt; as my mentor. We meet regularly to pair and discuss my progress. The founders are also providing advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-challenge&#34;&gt;First challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reasonably fast using my Windows laptop, Eclipse IDE and a German keyboard layout. But the first goal was to learn to be efficient using IntelliJ idea shortcuts, a Mac and the UK keyboard layout.
Why? Because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time between having an idea in my head and writing the code to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I practiced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZjgj1S0FCY&#34;&gt;Roman Numerals&lt;/a&gt; kata a few times, to learn some basic navigation skills and other shortcuts.
Then I moved on to refactoring the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata&#34;&gt;Trip Service&lt;/a&gt; kata. Refactoring is one of my favorite coding activities, and it felt very rewarding to speed it up.
One of the things I found most useful is the &lt;kbd&gt;⇧&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;&amp;#8984;&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;A&lt;/kbd&gt; Shortcut in IntelliJ IDEA. It allows you to search for any action available, be it a setting or a refactoring step. And it shows you the applicable shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://codurance.com/assets/img/custom/blog/findAction.png&#34; alt=&#34;Find Action&#34; title=&#34;Find Action&#34; class=&#34;img img-responsive style-screengrab&#34;/&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;baby-steps-for-better-design&#34;&gt;Baby steps for better design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued with our trainings &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/services/training/crafting-code/&#34;&gt;Crafting Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/services/training/crafted-design/&#34;&gt;Crafted Design&lt;/a&gt; and got a better understanding of Dependency inversion, Outside-In TDD and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ustre.am/:49XUG&#34;&gt;Interaction Driven Design&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to watch videos or read blog posts, but actually implementing and practicing has always been a more sustainable way of learning for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;peer-learning&#34;&gt;Peer learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Monday, all Codurance apprentices meet up in the office to learn together. We pair on katas, present lightning talks and have discussions.
We also started a book club and are currently reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/&#34;&gt;Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests&lt;/a&gt;. The regular meetups motivate to keep reading.
Additionally, discussing what each of us understood and took out of the material helps to reinforce the learning and clear up any misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we discussed was how the tests help us to look at the unit we are developing from the outside. So when we are writing tests, we should always ask: What are we promising to units interacting with our unit? What can they expect our &amp;lsquo;thing&amp;rsquo; to do?
Since all of us have different backgrounds, we can share our experiences and support each other. It&amp;rsquo;s great to be part of a group!
One of the craftsmen will join us on the meetings and provide us with advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-the-shoulders-of-giants&#34;&gt;On the shoulders of giants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of good design has already been described in length in various books and blogposts. On the advice of my mentor, I try to focus on reading one book at a time. I also try to read two blog posts a week on topics I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.
I read blog posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-12/cohesive-software-design&#34;&gt;cohesion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/coupling.pdf&#34;&gt;coupling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/composition-vs-inheritance-how-choose&#34;&gt;composition over inheritance&lt;/a&gt;, the four rules of &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html&#34;&gt;simple design&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2013/12/07/putting-an-age-old-battle-to-rest/&#34;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect is sharing my learnings, which is why I intend to regularly write on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Codurance blog&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s important to timebox reading and writing though, because my learnings usually come from doing :) By advice of my mentor, I try to spend 20% of my time on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also sharing by presenting at various conferences. I plan to attend SoCraTes unconferences in  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.socrates-conference.de/&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://socrates-fr.github.io/&#34;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.socratesbe.org/&#34;&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. I am presenting at &lt;a href=&#34;http://swancon.co.uk/&#34;&gt;SWANSEACON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xpdays.de/2015/&#34;&gt;XP Days Germany&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-for-codurance&#34;&gt;Working for Codurance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I am contributing to Codurance&amp;rsquo;s success is to help out with the recruitment efforts. Be it by reaching out to possible candidates or reviewing code submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideal-conditions&#34;&gt;Ideal conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just being around the Codurance office is a blessing. Here are some highlights: Spontaneous discussions about design, pairing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sandromancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt;, developing the website with &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/anainogal&#34;&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;, learning consultant skills from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mashooq&#34;&gt;Mash&lt;/a&gt;, discussing good design with &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/lrbpx&#34;&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, organizing meetups with &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/craftatheart&#34;&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;,..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biweekly, we also have a catch up with all of Codurance. We use this to keep each other up to date about what we are working on, what our challenges are and what we learned. We have some pizza and some presentations on topics we are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about pizza, there are lots of interesting meetups in London! My favorites so far are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/&#34;&gt;LSCC hands on&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Extreme-Programmers-London/&#34;&gt;eXtreme Programmers London&lt;/a&gt;. I am definitely planning on contributing on them! They also feature great discussions afterwards at the pub, which I really enjoyed.
I also had the honor to facilitate an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/&#34;&gt;LSCC talks&lt;/a&gt; meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another beneficial aspect is &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/2015/07/14/learning-from-our-failures/&#34;&gt;Codurance&amp;rsquo;s culture&lt;/a&gt;. I get feedback and advice and can give feedback myself. My opinion is valued and I am encouraged to be self organized and proactive. I keep my mentor updated on my progress. The founders and the mentor regularly check in on me to solve any problems that could arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-plans&#34;&gt;Future plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important expectation my mentor has is that I always know what to do next. Here are a few things I want to do:
I&amp;rsquo;ll propose more conference talks and might present or host more LSCC meetings.
I will also start working on a larger project (a journeyman&amp;rsquo;s piece, so to speak) to practice DevOps, Functional Programming and Domain Driven Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am excited to see where it leads me!&lt;/p&gt;
