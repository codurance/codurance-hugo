&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-background&#34;&gt;Some background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may know me from the various meetups in the city, especially my attendance at a number of &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship&#34;&gt;LSCC&lt;/a&gt; meetup events. Attending these events I learnt about various conferences like &lt;strong&gt;Devoxx&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SoCraTes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;JAX London&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Java2Days&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;OpenFest&lt;/strong&gt;, and I ended up attending and later presenting on various topic including &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/projects/adoptopenjdk/pages/AdoptOpenJDK&#34;&gt;Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time I met a lot of people with various levels of experience and my interest and urge to learn more about the Java/JVM platform, Code Quality, Software Design, XP Practices, Software Craftsmanship, etc&amp;hellip;, were on the rise and saw no end. And whilst attending these events I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sandromancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mashooq&#34;&gt;Mash&lt;/a&gt;, who were in those days hosting &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship&#34;&gt;LSCC&lt;/a&gt; events. I went to many of &lt;a href=&#34;www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship&#34;&gt;LSCC&lt;/a&gt; events, especially liked the hands-on sessions (which are still my favourite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that many things I learnt at such events and conferences wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always be immediately recognised or accepted at the workplace. And moving to another work environment didn&amp;rsquo;t always solve this problem fully. I found that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t learning what I wanted from my peers and the things I learnt from the community I couldn&amp;rsquo;t apply at work. Besides very few were really in tuned with what the community was about. So one fine day I decided to take charge of my career and make a serious decision and take up the Apprenticeship program offered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt; and go through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was urged to go this way after being inspired by Sandro&amp;rsquo;s book: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/0134052501&#34;&gt;The Software Craftsman&lt;/a&gt;, attending all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://socratesuk.org/&#34;&gt;SoCraTes UK&lt;/a&gt; conferences, and meeting with developers who valued and took pride of their work namely their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-we-are-just-now&#34;&gt;Where we are just now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now been nearly two months since I have been working for &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt;, a formidable force. And so it&amp;rsquo;s also about time that I share my experiences with my fellow mates and the community around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first few weeks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt;, I have been busy learning various things that have been chalked out for becoming a craftsman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working on a kata or learning a concept, we paired or did what is known as &amp;lsquo;mob programming&amp;rsquo; along with other apprentices and craftsmen. And most of the time used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;. Time boxing our work in intervals is something done both in groups and working individually. We would have a lot of discussions and retrospectives after working on a problem or writing some code from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;structure-of-my-program&#34;&gt;Structure of my program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used an internal tool based on the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.impactmapping.org/&#34;&gt;Impact Mapping&lt;/a&gt;. I soon got interested in it when I saw my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Singsalad&#34;&gt;Franzi&lt;/a&gt; (who is now a craftswoman) had used it to plan out her Apprenticeship route. Such a tool helps map out our goals and the tasks we need to perform to achieve it. And this can differ from person-to-person, depending on what they want to work on (driven by the Apprentice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mentor and other craftsmen reviewed them to get an idea of what I wanted to achieve for myself. And then its up to me to apply my own drive and perseverance to achieve the individual stories. My mentor and I meet and talk informally on a regular basis, many times pairing on a kata or a project or on the white board trying to get my head around a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;days-in-the-life-of-an-apprentice&#34;&gt;Days in the life of an Apprentice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the working hours quite flexible, remote working is also an option (when you are on the bench or if the client allows, if you are in a project). Our co-founders are understanding and compassionate about our individual situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings are at their minimum, except for a weekly Apprentices meeting (run by an Apprentice and guided by at least one Craftsperson) and a bi-monthly company-wide catchup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apprentices meetings are full of fun &amp;ndash; we are accompanied by at least one Craftsperson, who disperses their knowledge and experience from a wide variety of topics designed to help us in the journey and fill the gaps in our knowledge and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bi-monthly catchup involves sharing of knowledge via lightning talks, discussions and pairing sessions on pet projects over pizzas and beer (and of course veggies and non-alcoholic beverages for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism&#34;&gt;teetotalers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katas, code reviews, mob programming and projects make up a learning week - all of these done individually or when pairing with another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;katas&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis I have worked on different katas or try to solve the same kata in various different ways (using different testing and refactoring approaches). This in turn gave me better insights into designing and refactoring techniques. Trying to solve the same problem in different ways has a positive impact on our problem solving skills especially when writing code. In my case I also learnt how to use the different libraries and methods to write tests. I would like to cite &lt;strong&gt;Samir&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to you, for the suggesting this approach during the first week of my Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;code-reviews&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week we did a group code review and time-boxed ourselves, performed a retrospective at the end of each interval and ensured we delivered a good chunk of the feedback before close of play. Such regular code review exercises are helping all of us learn about how to code better as we are not only learning from feedback from the tools we used, but also through exchange of feedback from our peers who were involved in the group code review session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;software-design-specification-gathering-communication&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Design, Specification Gathering &amp;amp; Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we had an interesting mob-programming session where we were trying to model and write a game. At the end of the session, we had a retrospective, discussing the things we did well and didn&amp;rsquo;t do well. Each of the apprentices and craftsmen were performing a specific role i.e. Developer, Domain Expert, etc&amp;hellip; We learnt in retrospective, about areas where we could have done better and should focus on. That any test written gives immediate feedback about how well we have understood the domain and if we were taking the right approach. Why a certain approach when starting a project is more advantageous than another approach. What questions to ask and why it is important to ask the right questions to the domain expert or to give the right level of information to another developer and vice-versa. Sandro has described this process in detail in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/2015/11/01/practicing-well-crafted-design/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fun-socialising-and-sharing&#34;&gt;Fun, socialising and sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found our office environment to be conducive to learning, sharing and collaboration. We even have a pairing rota that we use from time-to-time to record or suggest pairing sessions during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share links to events, conferences, tweets, interesting articles, videos, blog posts, etc&amp;hellip; via slack, document discussions and brain dumps via Google doc, huddles during lunch- and tea- breaks to talk about anything we are working on. Thanks to the library of printed and digital books to our disposal, the huge collection of &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/blog&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://codurance.com/videos/&#34;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; on our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apprentices and some craftsmen have collectively started a social event which of course happens every Friday, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s dinner at a nearby restaurant, while at other times an indoor movie over snacks and drinks at our office premises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-is-worthwhile-and-that-s-why-we-are-here&#34;&gt;It is worthwhile and that&amp;rsquo;s why we are here&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a privilege to be able to work alongside very experienced craftsmen from our industry. We are very lucky and thankful to have the opportunity to be guided and mentored by talented and like minded developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first job where the company has a completely flat hierarchy and where we share similar values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-note&#34;&gt;Closing note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is fun and learning is enjoyable when we love what we do and are amongst friends with similar goals and aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope it was interesting. Looking forward to write more and share such experiences in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Sandro&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tomaz&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Alex&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Franzi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David&lt;/strong&gt; for all the feedback provided for this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding the biting point with pair programming</title>
      <link>http://codurance.com/blog/finding-the-biting-point/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-inevitable-imbalance-in-pair-programming&#34;&gt;The inevitable imbalance in pair programming.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point throughout a developers career, no matter their experience, they will most likely find themselves in a situation where they are either the Junior or the Senior of the two in a pair programming session. In this context, being the &lt;strong&gt;Junior&lt;/strong&gt; does not only mean being a less experienced developer, but it could also mean somebody that has not been introduced to the current project yet, or someone who is inexperienced with the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find yourself in this situation, you might notice that the junior developer of the two struggles getting to grips with the code, and the senior might feel as if they are carrying the weight of the pairing session on their back. This can certainly end up frustrating for both. As a result, the senior developer will jump in the driving seat behind the keyboard and lead the way, not much is exchanged between the two and the junior developer will simply watch until whatever task is completed, maybe trying to ask a question or provide some help here or there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://codurance.com/assets/img/custom/blog/finding-the-biting-point/picture1.png&#34;  class=&#34;img img-responsive style-screengrab&#34;/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So what happens when they switch roles? All of a sudden the junior of the two is put behind the keyboard and struggles to move forward. The senior will become frustrated and impatient, and both members of the team will feel uncomfortable working together, possibly creating tension within the entire working environment. This problem will stagnate and not go away because neither parties feel there is nothing they can do and in order to get the work done &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, the senior developer must continue to carry the weight of the work on the back while the junior developer watches.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://codurance.com/assets/img/custom/blog/finding-the-biting-point/picture2.png&#34;  class=&#34;img img-responsive style-screengrab&#34;/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even worse, what will happen when the junior developer will have to separate and work by themselves? This is both a cause and symptom of the junior developer sitting in the passenger seat too long. He was never able to drive for himself and as a result was never able to find the biting point of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-biting-point&#34;&gt;Finding the biting point?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning to drive a manual transmission car, the steps in order to move the car forward are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the clutch down all the way with your left foot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the car into first gear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly begin to put your right foot on the gas pedal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly lift your left foot off of the clutch until the car starts to accelerate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;http://codurance.com/assets/img/custom/blog/finding-the-biting-point/picture3.png&#34;  class=&#34;img img-responsive style-screengrab&#34;/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finding the sweet spot where the clutch meets the gears was taught to me as &amp;lsquo;Finding the biting point&amp;rsquo;. That biting point is a very specific feeling that you only experience once you have driven a car for yourself. You could watch someone work the pedals a thousand times but until you get behind them yourself you will never get used to their feedback or tension. To me, this intrinsic feeling also exists in software. I can remember times where I have been sitting in the back seat of a pairing session contributing sound and useful ideas and solutions. Once I was handed the keyboard I found myself stalling. This is because I was never able to find the biting point myself and gain my own understanding of the structure and feel of the code. This will most likely have to happen once, better sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-should-i-do&#34;&gt;So what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-junior-in-the-pair&#34;&gt;As a Junior in the pair&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s tough to admit ignorance, but everyone has to start somewhere. Ask questions often, if there&amp;rsquo;s a task you think you can handle, ask for the keyboard, request that your partner guides you and is patient with you while you get to grips with the code. Study in your own time. If possible and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, clone the repo on your machine and browse the code, branch off and try to add a new feature and see what will happen. Most importantly, be honest. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with not knowing something, however the same can not be said about holding yourself back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;as-a-senior-in-the-pair&#34;&gt;As a Senior in the pair&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage your pair, at regular intervals pass them the keyboard and guide them. Answer their questions where possible. Most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;try to be patient&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember that if you&amp;rsquo;re teaching a less experienced developer, you&amp;rsquo;re not only doing them a favour, but also strengthening your entire team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-takes-two-to-tango&#34;&gt;It takes two to tango.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to teach someone who is clearly showing they are not interested in learning, know that you&amp;rsquo;ve tried you&amp;rsquo;re best and don&amp;rsquo;t exert further effort until they are willing. Alternatively, if you&amp;rsquo;re eager to grab the keyboard from someone who is being particularly stubborn, it&amp;rsquo;s probably best to not stir further and just wait for a better opportunity. However this isn&amp;rsquo;t an opportunity to completely switch off, continue contributing where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good results will require effort and good will from both sides. Providing that that can be managed, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for you not to be strengthening your team during every pairing session.&lt;/p&gt;
