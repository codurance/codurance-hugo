&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-beginning&#34;&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar&#34;&gt;@SamirTalwar&lt;/a&gt; and the initiative he set upon himself to &lt;a href=&#34;http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/136667358499/automating-the-world&#34;&gt;automate the world&lt;/a&gt; I picked up on an idea I had many months ago. Automating the generation of presentations using GitHub commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-problem-am-i-trying-to-solve&#34;&gt;What Problem am I Trying to Solve?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I need to do a software related session and I have to present the code in small steps showing how I approached a problem. This usually involves a lot of copy and pasting code from a repository, one commit at a time, into PowerPoint or KeyNote or some other presentation application or framework. This is a very manual and error-prone process. Also, presentation applications usually know nothing about code, so I also need to hand format the copied code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the idea of automating this process but kept delaying it for some reason or another. After reading Samir&amp;rsquo;s posts I finally decided to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-language&#34;&gt;THE LANGUAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning F# and I decided this would be a perfect opportunity to do something useful with my new F# skills. Also this problem seemed well-suited to a functional approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;interfacing-with-github&#34;&gt;INTERFACING WITH GITHUB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has published a library to simplify calling their API. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/octokit&#34;&gt;OctoKit&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s available for numerous languages and platforms. Since I was using .Net I applied &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net&#34;&gt;OctoKit.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-the-presentation&#34;&gt;CREATING THE PRESENTATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I used Office automation frameworks by Microsoft to generate a PowerPoint presentation, but decided that going with a specific application could be too restrictive. So I started looking for a presentation framework with HTML5 and came across  &lt;a href=&#34;http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/&#34;&gt;Reveal.js&lt;/a&gt; that proved a good match for what I wanted to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;hightlighting-the-code-samples&#34;&gt;Hightlighting the Code Samples&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around with Reveal.js I found out that the code highlight features, out of the box, were a bit limited for what I wanted. So I searched for a framework that would work with Reveal.js. I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://prismjs.com/&#34;&gt;Prism.js&lt;/a&gt; did all I wanted and a bit more. I set out to integrate Prism.js with Reveal.js and finally had something that would meet my requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;fiddling-with-css&#34;&gt;Fiddling With CSS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part was to make some changes to Reveal.js and Prism.js CSS&amp;rsquo;s to get the desired visual effect. This is an area I&amp;rsquo;m a bit out of my comfort zone so it took me a while to get something half decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-end-result&#34;&gt;The End Result&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code, as it stands now, is still very crude but it&amp;rsquo;s capable of retrieving all commits for a file in a given repository and generating a presentation with Reveal.js. The presentation has a slide for each commit that changed the specified file. The slides use Prism.js to highlight the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a few things hardcoded in the F# code, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;consumer&amp;rdquo; ready product, but some developers might be able to use it as is. You can find the code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pedromsantos/GitHubAnimator&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
