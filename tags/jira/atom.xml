      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/&#34;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt; from Atlassian  is a very popular issue tracking software and can be quite effectively used for Agile Project Management. Jira has a plugin (Green Hopper) that allows for creation of a backlog, iterations and tasks.  However, with help from the free Mylyn plugin for Eclipse I was able to setup a Product Backlog and Iteration Backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the User Stories in the product backlog I created two issue types (Epic &amp;amp; User Story).  Story hierarchies can be represented using Jira Links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Note: Currently Jira connector in Mylyn has an issue with the &amp;ldquo;depends on&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;is depended on by&amp;rdquo; relationships. It displays them the wrong way around in the Tasklist hierarchy.  You can keep track of the following issues to see if they&amp;rsquo;re fixed: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=255680&#34;&gt;255680&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=223151&#34;&gt;223151.&lt;/a&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Iteration Backlog I created a version for each iteration and assigned the stories to that version/iteration. Each leaf story can then have Jira Sub-tasks to represent the tasks in a particular iteration. The &lt;code&gt;Resolved&lt;/code&gt; state of the story is used to mark it complete and &lt;code&gt;Colsed&lt;/code&gt; state is used to mark it as &amp;ldquo;accepted&amp;rdquo;. You can use Mylyn to see story hierarchies, also I found Mylyn to be a much more intuitive interface when working on Product and Iteration backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;
