            <h4>Codurance uses cookies and collects IP addresses.</h4>
            <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your internet browser on to your computer's hard drive. Like most website providers, Codurance uses cookies to enable us to make a link between you and the information you have provided to our website and therefore provide you with personalised content so that we can give you a better experience when you return. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, although you can choose not to.</p>
            <p>An IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet. We use analysis software to look at IP addresses and cookies for the purpose of enhancing your user experience. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you and the log files are regularly purged.

            <h4>How will Codurance use the information they collect about me?</h4>
            <p>Codurance will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    for "service administration purposes", which means that the Codurance may contact you for reasons related to the service you have signed up for (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance).
                </li>
                <li>
                    to contact you about a submission you have made to the websites, including any content you provide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    to personalise the way Codurance content is presented to you. IP addresses are used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from different countries and also to block disruptive use and to analyse and improve the services offered on Codurance websites e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    to enable us to review, develop and improve the products, services and special offers online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    to occasionally carry out market research.
                </li>
                <li>
                    to send you details of Codurance promotions, products, services, special offers and rewards that we think will be of interest to you. It's up to you to decide whether or not you want to receive this information.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where Codurance proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.</p>
