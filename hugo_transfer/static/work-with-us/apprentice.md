# Apprentice

### What is an apprenticeship?

An apprenticeship under Codurance is a process of learning. Guided by a dedicated mentor, you will hone the skills that are absolutely essential for a software craftsman.

As part of your apprenticeship, you'll learn:

  * how to **craft code** that is simple, clean, maintainable and easy to reason about
  * how to orient your **software design** around goals
  * **confidence** in your code that comes from applying Extreme Programming practices
  * software development **methodologies**, including Agile and Lean
  * **paradigms** and **design patterns** we apply to our code to clarify its intent
  * the mentality behind **Test-Driven Development** and how we test our code
  * the full **development lifecycle**, from your first print statement to a full system living in a production environment
  * **speaking** and **negotiating** skills, to allow you to convey your ideas about how to approach a solution
  * **tools** and **libraries** that help us become better at our craft

You won't be doing this alone. Your mentor will take responsibility for helping you grow and pushing your boundaries. What you learn, though, is really up to you: you'll decide what you'd like to focus upon and how you'd like to approach it.

### How long is an apprenticeship, and what happens afterwards?

An apprenticeship is flexible; we expect it to take somewhere between three and six months, but depending on experience, it can be longer or shorter. The duration doesn't matter to us, as long as you're learning. Once we're happy that you can work with our customers to the standard set by our existing craftsmen, you'll be offered a brand new contract as a craftsman at Codurance.

### What are you looking for in an apprentice?

We abide by a set of values, and are looking for apprentices who understand why. We want people who have:

  * the willingness to learn
  * an openness to new ideas
  * passion for technology and code
  * curiosity when encountering new concepts and tools
  * a flexible approach
  * the desire to create things of the highest quality
  * Some commercial experience in either **Java** or **C#**

### I want to apply. What do I need to do?

If you think Codurance is for you, drop us a line at **[hello@codurance.com](mailto:hello@codurance.com)** and tell us your story. If you're stuck for things to talk about, we have some suggestions:

  * How passionate are you about software?
  * With which technologies are you comfortable?
  * Which technologies are you currently learning?
  * Which technologies would you like to learn?
  * Do you have any favourite technical books / blogs?
  * Do you participate in any technical communities?
  * Are there any pet projects you are working on? Tell us about them. And relax; we promise not to steal your ideas and won't tell anyone.

We also want links. If you're up for sharing any of the following, send them along. If you don't have them, that's not a problem; we value people, not text.

  * any blog posts or articles you've written
  * your Twitter account
  * any open-source projects you've worked on
  * any pet projects you're particularly proud of
  * links to any applications you've worked on that are publicly available
  * anything else that can help us know more about you

Then just sit back and relax. We'll be in touch.
