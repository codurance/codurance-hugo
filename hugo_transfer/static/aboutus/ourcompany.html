                <p>Software Craftsmanship principles are at the heart of our company. Software Craftsmanship
                    is a movement that aims to bring professionalism to our industry. It's main principles are
                    highlighted
                    in the Software Craftsmanship manifesto:</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><i class="fa fa-tick"></i> Not only working software, but also <strong>well-crafted
                        software.</strong></li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-tick"></i> Not only responding to change but also <strong>steadily
                        adding value.</strong></li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-tick"></i> Not only individuals and interactions but also a
                        <strong>community of professionals.</strong></li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-tick"></i> Not only customer collaboration but also <strong>productive
                        partnerships</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Following the Software Craftsmanship principles we are constantly seeking ways to add value to the
                    team, resulting in observable constant improvements in technology and working practices. Our craftsmen are
                    always engaged with the wider <a href="http://londonswcraft.com">technical community</a> bringing the best
                    of that learning to their workplace. Working from within the team makes them highly effective in
                    bringing about positive change and innovation.</p>

                <p>We work very well embedded in projects with client staff in order to help nurture autonomous highly
                    effective teams.</p>

                <p>Our wide-ranging expertise in technologies and practices ensure that the right decisions are made
                    especially during the early phases of a project.
