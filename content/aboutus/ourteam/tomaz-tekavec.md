full_description = "<p>Tomaz figured out programming is his favourite hobby when he was a kid and never changed his mind since then. In the last 20 years Tomaz has created successful software solutions for clients ranging from clinical biophysics, pharmacy, media agencies, metal industry to government institutions. He was also a co-founder of two software companies but could never resist working in development teams. Creating and contributing to more than ten software products played an important role in his career. It drastically changed his mindset from 'read manual to use software' to 'don't make me think' concept, trying to guess users interaction with the software, which was still developing.</p>"
