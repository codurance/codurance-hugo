On 9th of April 2014, we created our first screencast on our new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/codurance). The idea is to have a series of (reasonably) short videos explaining some of the techniques we use when developing software. The videos will range from basic to advanced topics but in no particular order.

The first one is on Explanatory Methods. They are small private (helper) methods that can be used to explain the underlying behaviour and also to bring the domain language to life.

Subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/codurance) to receive notificaitons of future videos. We hope you like it.
